# COrnLathe for Windows
 
 Windows port of COrnLathe. COrnlathe is a program originally written by Bill Ooms for Mac computers. It is posted elsewhere in Github. 
 This is a functional port of that to Windows. 
 All that is required to operate is the zip file. 
 Download it, unzip to a convenient folder. Search in the BIN folder for mylathe1 and run it. 
 The program is known to run on WIndows versions 7, 10, and 11. Java may be needed to be installed for it to run. 
 All instructions are in the Help file on the top Ribbon. No further development of this program is planned. 
 It is provided 'as is' for people interested in an excellent Ornamental Turning design program which is also 
 capable of creating necessary GCode to cut the design on an appropriately configured CNC machine. 
 I would refer you to the billooms.com website and his YouTube videos for more information.
